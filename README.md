# Natural Language Feature Creation

This library provides simple character and token based feature creation
functions.  For additiona feature libraries and examples of how to use this
library see the [NLP parse library](https://github.com/plandes/clj-nlp-parse).


## Obtaining

In your `project.clj` file, add:

[![Clojars Project](https://clojars.org/com.zensols.nlp/feature/latest-version.svg)](https://clojars.org/com.zensols.nlp/feature/)


## Documentation

API [documentation](https://plandes.github.io/clj-nlp-feature/codox/index.html).


## Usage

The following illustrates how to create character and token based features:
```clojure
(:require [zensols.nlparse.feature.char :as cf]
          [zensols.nlparse.feature.word :as w])

(defn- tokenize [utterance]
  (->> (s/split utterance #"\s+")
       (map #(hash-map :text %))))

(defn calc-feature-1 [tokens]
  (log/debugf "calculating features for <%s>" (pr-str tokens))
  (merge (cf/capital-features tokens)
         (cf/unicode-features tokens 1)))

;; in a different namespace to calculate features for a different model...
(defn calc-feature-2 [tokens]
  (log/debugf "calculating features for <%s>" (pr-str tokens))
  (merge (cf/capital-features tokens)    
         (w/dictionary-features tokens)))

(let [tokens (->> "My name is Paul" tokenize)
      f1-features (calc-feature-1 tokens)
      f2-features (calc-feature-2 tokens)]
  (clojure.pprint/pprint {:f1 f1-features
                          :f2 f2-features}))
```

In this example, we're creating features for two different models in the
`calc-features-*` functions.  This is common where there are some common
features between models.  However, we're recalculating the capital case
features in `cf/capital-features`.  We have to do this in case where our
feature generation is in different namespaces or even different libraries/jars.

Fortunately, this library provides a way to avoid recreating these features as
shown below:
```clojure
(defn calc-feature-1 [tokens]
  (log/debugf "calculating features for <%s>" (pr-str tokens))
  (c/combine-features (cf/capital-features tokens)
                      (cf/unicode-features tokens 1)))

;; in a different namespace to calculate features for a different model...
(defn calc-feature-2 [tokens]
  (log/debugf "calculating features for <%s>" (pr-str tokens))
  (c/combine-features (cf/capital-features tokens)    
                      (w/dictionary-features tokens)))

(let [tokens (->> "My name is Paul" tokenize)
      f1-features (calc-feature-1 tokens)
      f2-features (calc-feature-2 tokens)]
  (clojure.pprint/pprint {:f1 f1-features
                          :f2 f2-features}))
```
We replace `merge` with `c/combine-features`, which adds these features to an
atom with a map.  For those features that are already created, namely
`cf/capital-features`, the function is not invoked a second time and uses the
value in the map in the atom.


## Citation

There are two utilities for looking up words:
* WordNet: wraps [this library](http://extjwnl.sourceforge.net)
* Word lists: English word lists taken from [this repo](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words)

Usage of these libraries are available as features with the
`dictionary-features` function found [here](https://plandes.github.io/clj-nlp-feature/codox/zensols.nlparse.feature.word.html#var-dictionary-features).

All other [word lists](ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/aspell/dict/0index.html) come from
the [GNU Aspell](http://aspell.net) dictionaries.
