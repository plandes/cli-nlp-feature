This library provides simple character and token based feature creation
functions.  For additiona feature libraries and examples of how to use this
library see the [NLP parse library](https://github.com/plandes/clj-nlp-parse).

  * [Dictionary features](https://plandes.github.io/clj-nlp-feature/codox/zensols.nlparse.feature.word.html#var-dictionary-features)
* [Token statistics]:
  * Average character length
  * Mention count
  * Sentence count
  * Stopword count
  * Interrogative indication
* [Character statistics]:
  * Capital tokens
  * Punctuation
  * Unicode
  * Repeating characters
  * Latin vs. Non-latin character sets
* [Feature utilities]
  * End/begin of sentence

## Obtaining

In your `project.clj` file, add:

[![Clojars Project](https://clojars.org/com.zensols.nlp/feature/latest-version.svg)](https://clojars.org/com.zensols.nlp/feature/)

## Documentation


API documentation:
* [Clojure](https://plandes.github.io/clj-nlp-feature/codox/index.html)
* [Java](https://plandes.github.io/clj-nlp-feature/apidocs/index.html)


## Usage

The following illustrates how to create character and token based features:
```clojure
(:require [zensols.nlparse.feature.char :as cf]
          [zensols.nlparse.feature.word :as w])

(defn- tokenize [utterance]
  (->> (s/split utterance #"\s+")
       (map #(hash-map :text %))))

(defn calc-feature-1 [tokens]
  (log/debugf "calculating features for <%s>" (pr-str tokens))
  (merge (cf/capital-features tokens)
         (cf/unicode-features tokens 1)))

;; in a different namespace to calculate features for a different model...
(defn calc-feature-2 [tokens]
  (log/debugf "calculating features for <%s>" (pr-str tokens))
  (merge (cf/capital-features tokens)    
         (w/dictionary-features tokens)))

(let [tokens (->> "My name is Paul" tokenize)
      f1-features (calc-feature-1 tokens)
      f2-features (calc-feature-2 tokens)]
  (clojure.pprint/pprint {:f1 f1-features
                          :f2 f2-features}))
```

In this example, we're creating features for two different models in the
`calc-features-*` functions.  This is common where there are some common
features between models.  However, we're recalculating the capital case
features in `cf/capital-features`.  We have to do this in case where our
feature generation is in different namespaces or even different libraries/jars.

Fortunately, this library provides a way to avoid recreating these features as
shown below:
```clojure
(defn calc-feature-1 [tokens]
  (log/debugf "calculating features for <%s>" (pr-str tokens))
  (c/combine-features (cf/capital-features tokens)
                      (cf/unicode-features tokens 1)))

;; in a different namespace to calculate features for a different model...
(defn calc-feature-2 [tokens]
  (log/debugf "calculating features for <%s>" (pr-str tokens))
  (c/combine-features (cf/capital-features tokens)    
                      (w/dictionary-features tokens)))

(let [tokens (->> "My name is Paul" tokenize)
      f1-features (calc-feature-1 tokens)
      f2-features (calc-feature-2 tokens)]
  (clojure.pprint/pprint {:f1 f1-features
                          :f2 f2-features}))
```
We replace `merge` with `c/combine-features`, which adds these features to an
atom with a map.  For those features that are already created, namely
`cf/capital-features`, the function is not invoked a second time and uses the
value in the map in the atom.


## Citation

There are two utilities for looking up words:
* [WordNet]: wraps [this library](http://extjwnl.sourceforge.net)
* Word lists: English word lists taken from [this repo](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words)

Usage of these libraries are available as features with the
`dictionary-features` function found [here](https://plandes.github.io/clj-nlp-feature/codox/zensols.nlparse.feature.word.html#var-dictionary-features).

All other [word lists](ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/aspell/dict/0index.html) come from
the [GNU Aspell](http://aspell.net) dictionaries.


## Building

To build from source, do the folling:

- Install [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org) (this is just a script)
- Install [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- Install [Git](https://git-scm.com)
- Download the source: `git clone https://github.com/clj-nlp-feature && cd clj-nlp-feature`
- Download the make include files:
```bash
mkdir ../clj-zenbuild && wget -O - https://api.github.com/repos/plandes/clj-zenbuild/tarball | tar zxfv - -C ../clj-zenbuild --strip-components 1
```
- Compile: `make compile` do compile or `make install` to install in your local
  maven repo.
