Natural Language Feature Creation
=================================

This library provides simple character and token based feature creation
functions.  For more rich feature library and examples of how to use this
library see the
[NLP parse Clojure library](https://github.com/plandes/clj-nlp-parse).

Obtaining
---------
In your `project.clj` file, add:

[![Clojars Project](https://clojars.org/com.zensols.nlp/feature/latest-version.svg)](https://clojars.org/com.zensols.nlp/feature/)

Documentation
-------------
Additional [documentation](https://plandes.github.io/clj-nlp-feature/codox/index.html).

Usage
-----
There are two utilities for looking up words:
* WordNet: wraps [this library](http://extjwnl.sourceforge.net)
* Word lists: English word lists taken from [this repo](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words)

Usage of these libraries are available as features with the
`dictionary-features` function found [here](https://plandes.github.io/clj-nlp-feature/codox/zensols.nlparse.feature.html#var-dictionary-features).

All other [word lists](ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/aspell/dict/0index.html) come from
the [GNU Aspell](http://aspell.net) dictionaries.
